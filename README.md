# hmrs_analysis

Simple statistical analysis on our multi-robot simulation environment. https://github.com/Gastd/morse_simulation

## Installation

Install jupyter on your environment and install the dependencies through pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Results

Run `jupyter notebook` to access the notebooks in the notebook folder, you can check mean and std values for our experiment in the Statistics.ipynb and
direct comparisons between Baseline and Planner results in the Comparison.ipynb file.

Finally all simulations are available as matplotlib animations in the animations folder and all the final positions for the robots are recorded in the plots folder.
